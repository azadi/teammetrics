Debian Teams Activity Metrics
=============================

The aim of this project is to gauge the performance of teams in Debian Pure Blends
by inspecting postings on relevant mailing lists, package upload records from the
Ultimate Debian Database and commit statistics from project repositories. The
information gathered will help in evaluating team performance by measuring how
people in a team are working together and an interface to access this information
easily will also be developed.
